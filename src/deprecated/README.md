# Deprecated Components

This directory parks deprecated files during cleanup. Do not delete until verified in prod.

Files here are intentionally kept (not deleted) to allow quick revert if needed during the restructuring process.

## Structure
- `.deprecated.astro` - Deprecated Astro components
- `.deprecated.tsx` - Deprecated React/TypeScript components  
- `.deprecated.ts` - Deprecated TypeScript files

## Safety
These files can be safely removed after the restructure is verified in production for at least one deployment cycle.
